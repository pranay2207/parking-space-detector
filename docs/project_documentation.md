# Parking Space Detector: Comprehensive Project Documentation

## Project Overview

The Parking Space Detector is a computer vision application designed to accurately identify and count occupied and vacant parking spaces in parking lot images and video streams. It uses a custom-trained YOLOv8 model optimized specifically for parking space detection.

## Model Training Details

### Dataset

The model was trained on a specialized parking space dataset with the following characteristics:

- **Classes**: 2 classes (`occupied` and `vacant` parking spaces)
- **Training data**: Located in `train/images` and `train/labels`
- **Validation data**: Located in `valid/images` and `valid/labels`
- **Test data**: Located in `test/images` and `test/labels`
- **Source**: Roboflow dataset "parking-space-4-wucim" (version 1)

### Training Process

The training process leveraged transfer learning by starting with a pre-trained YOLOv8 model (`yolov8n.pt`) and fine-tuning it on our parking space dataset:

- **Framework**: Ultralytics YOLOv8
- **Base model**: YOLOv8n (nano)
- **Epochs**: 50
- **Image size**: 640Ã—640 pixels
- **Batch size**: 16
- **Early stopping patience**: 20
- **Training time**: 2.395 hours (8621 seconds)

### Training Strategies

Several key training strategies were employed:

1. **Transfer Learning**: Started with a pre-trained model to leverage general object detection capabilities
2. **Data Augmentation**: Used mosaic augmentation for the first 40 epochs
3. **Adaptive Learning Rate**: Implemented learning rate scheduling, peaking at 0.00153 and gradually reducing to 4.97e-05
4. **Early Stopping**: Set to halt training if no improvement after 20 epochs (though the model continued improving)

## Model Performance Analysis

### Final Metrics

The trained model achieved exceptional performance on the validation dataset:

| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| mAP50 | 0.968 (96.8%) | Mean Average Precision at IoU threshold of 0.5 |
| mAP50-95 | 0.883 (88.3%) | Mean Average Precision across IoU thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95 |
| Precision | 0.952 | Proportion of correct detections among all detections |
| Recall | 0.921 | Proportion of actual spaces correctly detected |

### Class-Specific Performance

| Class | mAP50 | mAP50-95 | Precision | Recall |
|-------|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Occupied | 0.970 | 0.910 | 0.964 | 0.938 |
| Vacant | 0.965 | 0.856 | 0.940 | 0.912 |

### Training Progress

The training progression showed consistent improvement throughout the 50 epochs:

- **Early epochs (1-10)**: Rapid improvement from 0.540 to 0.943 mAP50
- **Middle epochs (11-30)**: Continued refinement from 0.953 to 0.969 mAP50
- **Final epochs (31-50)**: Fine-tuning with slight improvements from 0.966 to 0.968 mAP50

## Performance Analysis Visualizations

Key visualizations were generated during training to analyze model performance:

- **Precision-Recall Curve**: Shows the trade-off between precision and recall
- **Confusion Matrix**: Highlights correct classifications and misclassifications

- **GFLOPs**: 8.1
- **Layers**: 72 (after fusion)
- **Inference Speed**: ~42.3ms per image on CPU

## Inference Performance

The model demonstrates excellent real-world performance:

- **Processing Time**:
  - 0.7ms for preprocessing
  - 42.3ms for inference
  - 1.6ms for postprocessing

Project Rules for Parking Occupancy Detection App





Use Python 3.8+ for all development.



Use YOLOv8 (ultralytics) for computer vision tasks.



Use Streamlit for the web/mobile app frontend.



Use OpenCV for camera stream capture and processing.



Use pandas for data storage and numpy/shapely for geometric calculations.



Train model on provided dataset (train/, valid/, test/ with data.yaml).



Store parking space coordinates in JSON.



Save occupancy data to CSV.



Ensure app is responsive for mobile browsers.



Secure RTSP camera streams with authentication.



Deploy on a local server for pilot testing.



Follow modular code structure with clear comments.



Avoid external APIs or dependencies beyond specified libraries.
